With this plugin, you can set a relevance value of a post against a category.

== Description ==

Have you ever thought about, that putting a post in a category is so plain, and you need more sophisticated settings.
Let's say one post is more relevant to a category, than another one, so you want the more relevant posts to show up first, then the less relevant ones.

Now, it can be done easily, with Category Relevance plugin
